# Spelling-Bee
<b> CS2500 Spelling Bee Project </b>

In Fundamentals of Computer Science 1, I created a spelling bee game in Racket which receives input from the user and awards them points based on how many words they were able to make from the available letters. For each word to be valid, it has to be 4 letters or longer, use the middle letter in the word, be contained in the dictionary file, and not be a duplicate of a word already entered. If the word is 4 letters long it is awarded 1 point, an extra point is awarded for each letter beyond 4, and 7 bonus points are given for a word that uses all 7 letters.

In order to create this program, I used numerous fundamental concepts in Racket including:
- worlds, world states, key events, and the big-bang function
- images using overlay, place-image, and beside
- functions and templates
- check-expects (test cases)
- if statements
- conds (conditionals)
- predicates
- lists, recursion, and list abstractions
- lambdas (anonymous functions)
